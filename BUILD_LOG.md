# BUILD_LOG.md — Game Aurora Vertical Slice

Running log: what's built, test status, open issues, deviations. Newest milestone at the bottom.

## Environment

- **Engine:** Godot 4.6-stable (official, linux x86_64), installed at `/usr/local/bin/godot`.
- **Test framework:** GUT 9.6.0 at `addons/gut`.
- **Working headless test command** (confirmed against GUT 9.6.0):

  ```
  godot --headless --path . -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://test -ginclude_subdirs -gexit
  ```

  Wrapped in `./run_tests.sh` (auto-imports the project on first run; pass extra GUT args
  through, e.g. `./run_tests.sh -gselect=test_smoke.gd`).
- Note for playtesting: the project targets Godot **4.6 stable** — use that build locally.

## Doc provenance

`CLAUDE.md` and `VERTICAL_SLICE_BUILD_PLAN.md` were transcribed into the repo from the
human-supplied PDFs. Two values were cut off at the page edge in the PDF rendering and were
reconstructed (logged here per the deviation rule):

- **Damage `Random` coefficient** → `0.95–1.05` (the GDD states a "tight damage random
  range (0.95–1.05)"; the build plan PDF truncated at `Random 0.`).
- **Boss delay-resistance tail** → "immune at DR=100%" (matches the M1 test requirement
  "incl. immunity at DR=100%").

The GDD (Google Doc "Game Aurora") was reviewed for background; the build plan overrides
it wherever they differ.

## M0 — Project scaffold + test harness — DONE

**Built:**

- Godot 4.6 project skeleton (`project.godot`, 1280×720, mobile renderer for cheap grey-box).
- Folder layout per repo map: `/data`, `/components`, `/combat`, `/ui`, `/world`, `/test`,
  `/addons/gut`.
- GUT 9.6.0 installed; `run_tests.sh` CLI runner.
- Stub `CharacterData` resource script (`data/character_data.gd`) + a loading instance
  (`data/characters/bastil.tres`, placeholder numbers).
- `test/test_smoke.gd`: harness sanity + the stub resource loads with expected fields.

**Test status:** `2/2 passed (9 asserts)` — headless, green.

**Open issues:** none.

**Deviations:** none (doc reconstruction notes above).
